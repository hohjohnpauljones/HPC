To make the program execute: 
    make clean
    make
    make run

This will output a file called output.pgm that will contain the image to which the MedianFilter is applied.

To change the size of block (e.g. 3x3, 7x7, 11x11, or 15x15) open the Makefile and edit the value after ./hw6 <3 or 7 or 11 or 15> lena.png output.png
